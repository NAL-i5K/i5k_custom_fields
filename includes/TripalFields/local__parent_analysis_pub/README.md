# Parent Analysis Publication

## Purpose
To list and link to publications that belong to the parent analysis of the gene or mRNA.

## Associated Content Types
 - gene
 - mRNA

## How it works
For each gene/mRNA, there is an associated Analysis content type. In Chado, this relationship can be found via the chado.analysisfeature table. With the Analysis in hand, we can now find any Publications tied to that Analysis.

# i5k Custom Fields

This module is designed to provide a number of custom fields for various content types on Tripal i5k websites.

The files to create the fields were generated by the [Tripal Fields Generator](https://github.com/tripal/fields_generator). For historical purposes, in each field directory, there is a text file that describes the values used in the Fields Generator.

Currently, the following fields are provided:
 - [x] Parent publication for gene/mRNA
   - On gene and mRNA pages, any publications tied to the originating analysis will be shown. [Origin: #315](https://github.com/isdapps/i5k-tripal/issues/315)
 - [x] Polypeptide Annotations
   - On mRNA pages, related polypeptide annotations will be shown.
 - [ ] Analysis Author(s)
   - A list of authors tied to the analysis. ADC equivalent: 'Author name'. [Origin: #344](https://github.com/isdapps/i5k-tripal/issues/344)
 - [ ] Analysis Contact
   - A primary contact for the analysis. ADC equivalent: 'Contact name'. [Origin: #317](https://github.com/isdapps/i5k-tripal/issues/317)
 - [ ] Contact Identifier
   - A published identifier (Orcid, Google Scholar, etc.) tied to a specific contact. Will require a dbxref table
